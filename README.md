machine learning---(it is a learning tool)

primary task--
-----------------
train with seen data and predict with unseen data
a -> b mapping and its simulated function (y = mx+c)

output--
---------
mapping function and prediction

workflow- 
----------
collect data->train model->deploy model->save and serve


the system is a machine learning enabled system
------------------------------------------------
if 
1- with past predict future(key points)
2- kind of statistical hypothesis---come later
3- learn from its experience wrt to time 
4- intelligence by its own no hardcoding(key points)

thumb rule-- 95% accuartely (Or error metrics)
--- i try to recognie some color --train my system ---
--- in the run time i want to predict 95 % accurately out of total
----10 colored images , i have to pick 8-9 pics with its true(exact) color


Or this is not a machine learning enabled system
-------------------------------------------------
data science---(examine data and provide insights)


primary task--
--------------
collect data , analyze and interpret(hypothesis)
-- different city temperature in India analysis
-- hypotheisis will be created and challenge status quo
-- based on statistical test get data and its inferences
-- inform the same to the business users 

output-
-------- 
help business to make use data driven inferences

workflow-
---------
collect data->analyze-> inference(hypothesis)

the system is a data science enabled system
-------------------------------------------
1- data should be analyzed poperly (sample and population analysis)
2- create hypothesis and validate data to understand data behavior
3- get inferences using hypothesis and relevant test
4- help business to make use of inferences and strategize accordingly

Or this is not a data science enabled system


understand data landscape---
============================

1- a better understanding of from where data is coming, 
where data is residing in intermediate layers (what forms of its own or any other) 
to attain transformations.

2- from your frontend or program execution point of view how are you going to get 
your data( as object mounted to some point or object reference or static files)

3- finally data being used/consume by the program in your dedicated layers to generate 
intermediate files (locally or object reference), used in between as well to solve the 
purpose.


Reasoning--
===========
you are always open for any discussion that will navigate through your data 
platform (especially machine learning or data science) . In essence, you will provide 
your valuable and sound understanding often required to formulate and evaluate use case 
ascertained to that.
